- README is complete
- use of GitHub: you could rely more on GitHub during the work on you code

- Organization: you could group header and source files in foalders and create separate files for the tests
- the code is well commented and organized

- tests are complete and clear

- friend functions should be defined outside of the class.
    You can deifne them either in the header or source file, but beware to add an explicit instantiation if you define them in the src

- you could overload the stream operator<< instead of defining a print method for the class
- sparse matrix format is especially useful when you have very big matrices, so you should allow to print them.
    In that case, you could display only row and column number and value of the non-zero entries, instead of the full matrix to improve readability.

- the matrix-vector operator does not work as expected: the product of a 5X3 matrix and a column vector of dimension 3 should give a column vector of dimension 5.
    This happens both in the case where the vector is a std::vector and when it is a one-column matrix.
